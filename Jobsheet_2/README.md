### 2.1.3 Question
*Brief explanaton:* 
1. - Object: Can be created many times and specific
   - Class: can be declared only once and general
2. There are 4 attribute in student08 class:
   - Student ID
   - Name
   - Class Name
   - GPA
3. There are 4 method in student08 class:
   - print student identity
   - Change Class Name
   - Update GPA
   - Evaluate the GPA
4. ![Screenshot](../Jobsheet_2/img/updateGPA.png)
5. The evaluate() method  evaluated student performance based on their GPA (Grade Point Average) and categorizes it into four different performance levels: "Excellent," "Good," "Fair," and "Poor."

## 2.2 Experiment 2 Solution
### 2.2.2 Verification Experiment Result
The solution is implemented in studentMain08.java, and below is screenshot of the result.

### 2.2.3 Question
*Brief explanaton:* 
1. ![Screenshot](../Jobsheet_2/img/soal1_experiment2.png)
2. We can acces attributes or method of an object by calling it after object. For example, student1 as object and print() as method, we can acces it by doing student1.print();  
3. Because in the second calls to print(), we have called the method of changeClass and updateGPA. So, that's why the output is different.
